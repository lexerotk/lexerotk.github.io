This is a project for creating some kind of personal website for myself. And this is also being one of my first website projects too. So don't expect it to be perfect for your eyes.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcb6d17a-3fdd-44a2-9fc3-489b8d4752e0)

Created with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Nothing special.

Hosting via [Github Pages](https://github.io)

Performance & security by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

Using [Umami](https://umami.is/) for measuring page traffic. Which is open-source and privacy focused.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This website uses two different APIs to take control over VPN, proxy, and Tor users. Please check this repository for more info: [lexerotk/proxy-detection](https://github.com/lexerotk/proxy-detection/)

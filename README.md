# [lexerotk.me](https://lexerotk.me)

This is a project for creating some kind of personal website for myself.

Created with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Nothing special.

Using [Umami](https://umami.is/) for measuring page traffic. Which is open-source and privacy focused.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This website uses two different APIs to take control over VPN, proxy, and Tor users. Please check this repository for more info: [lexerotk/proxy-detection](https://github.com/lexerotk/proxy-detection/)

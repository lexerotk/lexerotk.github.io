But in fact, no. <b>I do not store any IP addresses.</b> IP addresses are only being collected to check the security of connection. Your IP address is only stored in your own browser's local storage for 3 hours as trusted IP address to not overdo the security check.</span>
                <span class="text">The algorithm of the security check is; the website checks your browser's local storage to see if you have the trusted key. If you don't have that or your IP address is changed recently or trusted key is older than 3 hours system collects your IP address with an API and then sends this IP address to a different API to see if your IP address is suspicious or not. Then by the result system writes the trusted key to local storage or sends you to "blocked" page. While these happens IP addreses not stored in anyway, just sent to an API.</span>
